## 📌 Note from the Creator

All the code for this website has been created **with the help of Lovable (ChatGPT)**.  
As of **May 2025**, I have **not learned** how to code any of this myself.

This website is a product of my **creative vision**, built with the **technical support** of AI assistance. I'm currently on my journey to learn and understand web development more deeply.
